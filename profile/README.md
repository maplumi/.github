# Welcome to Maplumi Labs 🌍

**Geospatial Intelligence & Data Infrastructure for Humanitarian Insights**

We build open-source tools and data infrastructure that make complex geographic data accessible, performant, and actionable.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### [Maplumi Power BI Visual](https://github.com/maplumi/maplumi-pbi)
Production-ready geospatial visualization for Microsoft Power BI with choropleth regions, scaled circles, and multiple rendering engines (SVG, Canvas, WebGL).

### [GeoBoundaries Lite](https://github.com/maplumi/geoboundaries-lite)
Lightweight, CDN-ready administrative boundary data (countries, states, districts) delivered via jsDelivr with compact manifests and TopoJSON optimization.

### [IPC Areas Toolkit](https://github.com/maplumi/ipc-areas)
Automated pipeline for Integrated Food Security Phase Classification boundaries—fetch, harmonize, and distribute global IPC area data.

### [Braine Web](https://github.com/maplumi/braine-web)
Experimental cognitive substrate research exploring novel computational paradigms with WebAssembly.
