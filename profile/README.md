**Maplumi is a technology lab focusing on intelligent systems, autonomous tools, and scalable data infrastructure.**

Dedicated to advancing practical, research-driven technology that supports complex social systems and mission-driven organizations, Maplumi works through remote, small, focused teams and guided agents that identify real-world challenges, design thoughtful solutions, and build reliable tools.

Our approach combines applied research with disciplined engineering. Where appropriate, we share selected tools, provide structured access to collaborators, and develop sustainable partnerships. Our work is sustained through grants, strategic partnerships, and contributions.
